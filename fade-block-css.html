<p>This post is written during a batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a">Recurse Center</a>, a retreat for programmers.</p>

<p>One aspect I've gotten stuck on with the styling of this blog is code blocks. I've tried adding a border and/or a background color in the past, but I couldn't stick with either of them and constantly kept changing styles.</p>

<p>I wanted a subtler indication to scroll if a block overflows, and a fading gradient towards seemed like a good option.</p>

<p>Here's the CSS I wrote for it:</p>

<pre><code>pre {
  position: relative;
  background: white;
}
pre::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 95%;
  right: 0;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, white);
}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  pre {
    background: black;
  }
  pre::after {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, black);
  }
}
pre code {
  display: block;
  padding: 0.75rem 0;
  overflow: auto;
  padding-inline-end: 1.5rem;
}</code></pre>

<p>The key behind this effect is the <code>::after</code> pseudo-element, which is a linear-gradient positioned to the right end of the <code>pre</code> block. The <code>left</code> value ensures that the gradient doesn't overlap the block completely, and acts as a subtle gradient, suggesting the user to scroll to see the code.</p>

<p>Usually I'd add the scroll to the <code>pre</code> block, however since we want the pseudoelement to stay at a fixed position, the scroll and overflow is applied to the child block - the <code>code</code> element in this case.</p>

<p>The gradient hiding overflow text makes sense, but this also covers the text at the end of the scroll. This is fixed by adding <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-inline-end"><code>padding-inline-end</code></a> to the <code>code</code> element, which adds padding at the end of scroll.</p>

<p>Here's how it looks:</p>

<pre><code>This is a super long string of text that appears to be faded where the text overflows.</code></pre>

<p>While I've demonstrated this for codeblocks, this styling could be extended for any block element - say a paragraph within a div, or a paragraph within a blockquote.</p>
