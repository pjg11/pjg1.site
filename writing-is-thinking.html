<p>I started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34507927">How To Take Smart Notes</a> by Sönke Ahrens recently (by recently I mean read it for a bit months ago and never picked it up since), and the overarching concept of <strong>Writing Is Thinking</strong> stood out to me. There have been many instances where I&rsquo;ve followed this concept without even realizing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Journaling thoughts to make more sense of the situation</li>
<li>Creating notes to understand concepts</li>
<li>Brainstorming ideas by either free-form writing or mind-mapping</li>
<li>Writing down all thoughts and tasks from my head to make sense of things, also known as a braindump</li>
</ul>
<p>This excerpt from the book summarizes this idea perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interview him. When he spotted Feynman&rsquo;s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such &ldquo;wonderful records of Feynman&rsquo;s thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Feynman protested. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the historian said, &ldquo;the work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not a record, not really. It&rsquo;s working. You have to work on paper, and this is the paper.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
