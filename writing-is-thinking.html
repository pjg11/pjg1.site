<p>I started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34507927">How To Take Smart Notes</a> by Sönke Ahrens recently (by recently I mean read it for a bit months ago and never picked it up since), and the overarching concept of <strong>Writing Is Thinking</strong> stood out to me. There have been many instances where I’ve followed this concept without even realizing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Journaling thoughts to make more sense of the situation</li>
<li>Creating notes to understand concepts</li>
<li>Brainstorming ideas by either free-form writing or mind-mapping</li>
<li>Writing down all thoughts and tasks from my head to make sense of things, also known as a braindump</li>
</ul>
<p>This excerpt from the book summarizes this idea perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interview him. When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.”</p>
<p>“No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.”</p>
<p>“Well,” the historian said, “the work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not a record, not really. It’s working. You have to work on paper, and this is the paper.”</p></blockquote>
