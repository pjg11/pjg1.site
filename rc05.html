<h1>RC05: Creating and hosting a CTF challenge in two days</h1>
<p><time datetime="2023-10-11 23:00:00 +0400">October 11, 2023</time></p>
<p>I've <a href="https://writeups-pjg1.netlify.app">played quite a few CTFs</a>, but hadn't attempted to create and host one before. With the announcement of Impossible Stuff Day at RC last week<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, it seemed like a good opportunity to finally give it a shot.</p>

<p>This post covers details of the challenge and the underlying infrastructure. The source files are up on <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/quack-ctf-challenge">pjg11/quack-ctf-challenge</a> if you'd like to try it out yourself!</p>

<h2 id="the-initial-plan">The initial plan</h2>

<p>My aim was to host one (1) challenge, with interaction via <code>ssh</code> or <code>nc</code>, as a web-based challenge would take more time to set up.</p>

<p>For challenge ideas, I was inspired by <a href="https://ctftime.org/task/25620">Wordle Bash</a>, a challenge I attempted while playing NahamCon CTF this year. I found it tricky to solve, but liked the game-like nature of the challenge.</p>

<p>The target audience were fellow Recursers - some with CTF experience but a big majority of people being possibly new to them. Having an easy challenge made sense here, allowing me to focus more on the setup.</p>

<p>Looking for existing CTF setups brings up mentions of open-source frameworks like <a href="https://ctfd.io">CTFd</a>. This seemed overkill for my case, so I decided to host the challenge from one (1) Docker container on a server - a DigitalOcean droplet with a 25GB SSD and 1GB RAM.</p>

<p>The challenge would be accessible over SSH, but on a different port than 22 as that is the droplet's SSH port.</p>

<p>The container acts as a sandboxed environment - the user is restricted to the container's filesystem and can't access the server's files<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="a-test-dockerfile">A test Dockerfile</h2>

<p>When looking for Dockerfiles of other CTF challenges, I came across a video - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSoNSgzp5Yo">BASH ALIAS CTF Challenge built w/ Docker</a> by John Hammond, a cybersecurity content creator and also the author of Wordle Bash.</p>

<p>He used <a href="https://github.com/rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd"><code>ubuntu-sshd</code></a> as the base image. The image hadn't been updated for recent Ubuntu versions, so I took the code from one of the Dockerfiles and used that as my starting point.</p>

<pre><code>FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y openssh-server &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get clean -y

RUN useradd -m user -s /bin/bash &amp;&amp; \
    echo "user:pass" | chpasswd &amp;&amp; \
    mkdir /var/run/sshd

WORKDIR /home/user

EXPOSE 22
CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]</code></pre>

<p>This creates a user apart from the root user, and runs the SSH server with <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/sshd.8.html"><code>-D</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>-D</code> <br>
When this option is specified, sshd will not detach and does not become a daemon. This allows easy monitoring of sshd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried a test run, and it worked! I also found out that Docker makes it very easy to forward ports from the Docker container to the host machine, something I wasn't sure how to do before.</p>

<pre><code># docker build -t test .
[+] Building 32.4s (9/9) FINISHED
# docker run -d -p 20000:22 test
858a1c9b2658715ebc074f8c6de189ebf5fb0b3005d02a5466159a63bae1f75e
# ssh -p 20000 localhost
user@858a1c9b2658:~$ </code></pre>

<p>SSH by default logs into a shell session, however I wanted to run the challenge file at login instead. I couldn't find how to do so, which lead me to change the setup entirely, as I was short on time.</p>

<h2 id="sshd--xinetd"><code>sshd</code> → <code>xinetd</code></h2>

<p>I came across another CTF challenge - <a href="https://github.com/JohnHammond/misfortune-ctf-challenge">misfortune</a>, also written by John Hammond. This challenge used <code>xinetd</code> instead of <code>sshd</code> to run the challenge, and users can access the challenge over <code>nc</code> or netcat.</p>

<p>I wanted to test this out with the Wordle Bash source code, so the following changes were made:</p>

<pre><code>FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y gpg curl xinetd &amp;&amp; \
    mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings &amp;&amp; \
    curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key \
    | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg &amp;&amp; \
    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *" \
    | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y gum &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get clean -y</code></pre>

<p>The installation is a lot longer, as it includes the setup required for <code>gum</code>, used for the input fields in Wordle Bash.</p>

<pre><code>RUN useradd -m user -s /bin/bash &amp;&amp; \
    echo "user:pass" | chpasswd

COPY challenge.xinetd /etc/xinetd.d/challenge
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

RUN chmod 551 entrypoint.sh &amp;&amp; \
    chown -R root:root /home/user

WORKDIR /home/user</code></pre>

<p>There are two additional files required for this to work, which I'll talk about shortly.</p>

<pre><code>EXPOSE 9999
CMD ["/entrypoint.sh"]</code></pre>

<p>The port number changes from <code>22</code> to <code>9999</code>, and a shell script called <code>entrypoint.sh</code> is provided as the starting command, which runs the <code>xinetd</code> server.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

/etc/init.d/xinetd start;
trap : TERM INT; sleep infinity &amp; wait</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, <code>challenge.xinetd</code> contains information provided to the server, like the type of server, port number and the script to be run.</p>

<pre><code>service challenge
{
    disable     = no
    socket_type = stream
    protocol    = tcp
    wait        = no
    user        = root
    type        = UNLISTED
    port        = 9999
    bind        = 0.0.0.0

    server      = /home/user/wordle_bash.sh

    log_type       = FILE /var/log/challenge.log
    log_on_success = HOST PID
    log_on_failure = HOST
}</code></pre>

<p>This wasn't successful, as the script wouldn't wait for input.</p>

<pre><code># nc localhost 9999

<p>To see if this was specific to this script, I tested the same setup with a much smaller script, which worked fine.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

echo "What is your name?"
read name
echo Hello $name</code></pre>

<p>This meant my plans for the challenge had to change, and I couldn't use <code>gum</code> for input as I initially hoped<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. At this point, Impossible Stuff Day was coming to an end, so I decided to work on the challenge aspect the next day.</p>

<h2 id="building-quack">Building QUACK</h2>

<p>Once the initial plan for the challenge failed, I started to think about it more seriously. I looked to challenges I'd played before, particularly these two:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pjg11/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/2022-NahamCon-CTF/Prisoner.md">Prisoner</a> from NahamCon CTF 2022</li>
  <li><a href="https://heinandre.no/htb-cyber-apocalypse-2022/misc/compressor/">Compressor</a> from Cyber Apocalypse 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't have the source code for either challenge, but Prisoner seemed easier to recreate, so I went in that direction.</p>

<p>Prisoner is an example of the <code>pyjail</code> style of challenges, where one is provided access to a restricted Python environment, and you're required to escape the <em>jail</em> to access the flag. The core steps are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start off with an input prompt that doesn't do anything when typing into it. The challenge can be assisted with ASCII art, to create a story.</li>
  <li>Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> prints a traceback and displays a Python interactive shell.</li>
  <li>In this shell, one can execute system commands and read the flag.</li>
</ul>

<p>For my challenge, I added one extra step. I stored the flag in a hidden directory called <code>.secret</code>, which might add an extra step for those who tend to use <code>ls</code> without any flags to list files.</p>

<p>For the ASCII art, I went with this <a href="https://www.asciiart.eu/animals/birds-water">cute duck</a>, because the challenge started off as a reference to Rubber Duck Debugging.</p>

<pre><code>    __
___( o)&gt;
\ &lt;_. )
 `---'   hjw</code></pre>

<p>While the challenge eventually took a different turn in terms of the story, the duck stuck around. I named the challenge after it too - QUACK.</p>

<p>I found two ways to show the traceback + interactive shell:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Embed an interactive shell within the Python script.</li>
  <li>Run the source code with <code>python3 -i</code></li>
</ol>

<p>I went with the second option first, making the source code itself very simple. I start off with a sleepy duck, and a while loop asking for input.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("""
    __
___( -)&gt;
\ &lt;_. )
 `---'   hjw
""")

while True:
    input("&gt; ")</code></pre>

<p>I was still using the <code>xinetd</code> setup, so I faced issues with interactivity once again.</p>

<pre><code># nc localhost 9999
    __
___( -)&gt;
\ &lt;_. )
 `---'   hjw

&gt; quack
&gt; hello?
&gt; ^D
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/user/quack.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    input("&gt; ")
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
&gt;&gt;&gt;
# </code></pre>

<p>It displays the traceback and shell prompt as expected, but exits before I could even type anything in the interactive shell… *sigh*</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure why this happened, but my guess is <code>nc</code> sees <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> as a signal to close the connection. I couldn't find any solution for this, so I tried the first option I mentioned earlier, to embed a shell in the code. This recreates the output produced by <code>python3 -i</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import readline
import code
from traceback import print_exc
from sys import exit

print("""
A sleepy duck is blocking the way to my files.
Can you wake it up (gently) and ask it for
flag.txt? Thanks!
    __
___( -)&gt;
\ &lt;_. )
 `---'   hjw
""")

try:
    while True:
        input("&gt; ")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    exit()
except EOFError:
    print("""
    __
___( O)&gt;
\ &lt;_. )
 `---'    hjw
""")
    print_exc()
    code.InteractiveConsole(globals()).interact(banner="",exitmsg="")</code></pre>

<p>The challenge now has a more cohesive story tying it together. The goal is to try and wake up a sleepy duck (gently), and access the flag. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> or <code>EOFError</code> works, however <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> or <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> would be considered too harsh, and the program exits.</p>

<p><code>print_exc()</code> prints the traceback, and <code>code.InteractiveConsole()</code> provides the interactive shell.</p>

<p>Lastly, I created a flag file, which the users can read on entering the shell. It follows the format commonly found in CTFs - some text written within braces in 1337 5p34k to make it look all cool and fancy:</p>

<pre><code># echo "CTF{th4nks_f0r_p14y1ng}" &gt; flag.txt</code></pre>

<p>I made the changes to the Dockerfile and other files, and once again, I faced the "EOF when reading a line" I saw earlier. I found myself at a dead end, so I gave up on this setup, and finally went back to using SSH.</p>

<h2 id="xinetd--sshd"><code>xinetd</code> → <code>sshd</code></h2>

<p>The only thing stopping me from using <code>sshd</code> earlier was not knowing a way to run a script at login, which I <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/397696">finally figured</a>. With that sorted, I got rid of <code>challenge.xinetd</code> and <code>entrypoint.sh</code>, and made the final set of changes to the Dockerfile:</p>

<p><code>python3</code> got added to the installation, as the challenge file is a Python script. The base image changed from Ubuntu to Debian for a smaller image size.</p>

<pre><code>FROM debian:latest

RUN apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y python3 openssh-server &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get clean -y</code></pre>

<p>Alongside user creation, I created the hidden directory, copied required files to the container and set appropriate permissions.</p>

<pre><code>RUN useradd -m user -s /bin/bash &amp;&amp; \
    echo "user:pass" | chpasswd &amp;&amp; \
    mkdir "/home/user/.secret"

COPY quack.py /home/user/quack.py
COPY flag.txt /home/user/.secret/flag.txt

WORKDIR /home/user

RUN chmod 444 /home/user/.secret/flag.txt &amp;&amp; \
    chmod u+x /home/user/quack.py &amp;&amp; \
    chown -R root:root /home/user</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, the <code>ForceCommand</code> parameter is added to the config file before running the SSH server.</p>

<pre><code>RUN echo "ForceCommand /home/user/quack.py" &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
    mkdir /var/run/sshd

EXPOSE 22
CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]</code></pre>

<h2 id="finishing-touches">Finishing touches</h2>

<p>As I was testing and running containers multiple times throughout the process, I created a script to automate it.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
set -ex

docker build -t quack .
docker run --pids-limit 100 --read-only -d -p 9999:22 quack</code></pre>

<p>This builds and runs the container in read-only mode, preventing the user from making changes to the flag or any other file. The number of processes running at once have also been limited, to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28237906/limit-number-of-processes-started-inside-docker-container">prevent forkbombs</a>. This wouldn't be much of an issue in my case, but I had it there just in case.</p>

<p>After multiple detours and changes, I tested the challenge setup, and it worked.</p>

</figure>
<p>After making sure it all works for the 100th time, I sent a message on our chat platform, in the style of a CTF challenge description:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>QUACK
easy | 100 points | misc

A sleepy duck is blocking the way to my files.
Can you wake it up (gently) and ask it for
flag.txt? Thanks!</code></pre>

  <p>The challenge is accessible at <code>ssh -p 9999 user@&lt;IP&gt;</code>, the password is <code>pass</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="running-the-challenge">Running the challenge</h2>

<p>For the 5 hours the challenge was live, I received a total of 6 flag submissions! (For context, this was posted this later in the day on a Friday without much prior notice, so not bad at all!)</p>

<p>The way to submit was to message me the flag directly. Not the most sophisticated setup, but it worked, and I got some positive feedback too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>What a lovely capture the flag!</li>
    <li>Fun challenge, thank you!</li>
    <li>I really love what you made here! Thanks again!</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing I really found missing was some form of logging, which I made an attempt at while writing this post.</p>

<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>

<p>I was looking to log two things - the number of challenge attempts and the number of solves. Nothing too fancy, just everything in one log file would also work.</p>

<h3 id="challenge-attempts">Challenge attempts</h3>
<p>SSH logs to <code>/var/auth/auth.log</code> by default. However, that I wasn't seeing any log file when I ran my setup. At the time, I missed a crucial detail - my container was set to read-only, so the log file wasn't being created.</p>

<p>To solve this, I added the <code>-e</code> flag to the Dockerfile command, which prints the logs to <code>stderr</code> instead of a file:</p>

<pre><code>CMD ["/usr/bin/sshd", "-e", "-D"]</code></pre>

<h3 id="challenge-solves">Challenge solves</h3>
<p>I started thinking of a backup to reliably track submissions, in case someone solved it but forgot to send me a message. I figured logging the number of times the file was accessed could be a potential solution.</p>

<p>I came across a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/56774750">StackOverflow answer</a> for the same, which used <code>inotifywait</code> to watch at the flag file, and performs commands when the file is opened. I looked up the <code>man</code> page and changed the syntax according to what I was looking for.</p>

<pre><code>inotifywait -e open .secret/flag.txt -m --format "[%T] %w %e" --timefmt "%F %T"</code></pre>

<p>The command watches for the flag file to open, and prints output in the following format when the file is accessed:</p>

<pre><code>[2023-10-11 13:30:00] .secret/flag.txt OPEN</code></pre>

<p>It would run in the background, as the SSH server is running in the foreground. Since there are multiple shell commands to be executed at build time, using an entrypoint script, like in the <code>xinetd</code> setup makes more sense. This would run the <code>inotifywait</code> command as a background process and <code>sshd</code> as a server.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

inotifywait -e open .secret/flag.txt -m --format "[%T] %w %e" --timefmt "%F %T" &amp;
/usr/sbin/sshd -D -e</code></pre>

<p>The Dockerfile would also change accordingly.</p>

<pre><code>COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod 551 /entrypoint.sh
CMD ["/entrypoint.sh"]</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't account for multiple flag reads by the same user, but some manual filtering of the logs could solve the issue in my case.</p>

<h3 id="accessing-logs">Accessing logs</h3>
<p>The logs are accessible using the <code>docker logs</code> command:</p>

<pre><code># docker logs &lt;containerid&gt;</code></pre>

<p>During the challenge, appending the <code>-f</code> file to command shows log entries as they appear. Once the challenge is over and I've stopped the container, I can redirect the output of the command (without <code>-f</code>) to a file.</p>

<p>This would contain a combination of SSH logs and the file access logs, which I could filter out using tools like <code>grep</code>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Given the timeframe of two days, I'm honestly surprised I was even able to do this much. I'm glad to be a part of a community like RC, that encourages people to try things they otherwise wouldn't.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this, and if you do try out the challenge, feel free to leave a comment with any feedback!</p>
