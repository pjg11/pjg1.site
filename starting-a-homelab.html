  <h1>Starting a Homelab</h1>
  <p class="byline"><time datetime="2025-11-08T23:59:00&#43;04:00">November 8, 2025</time></p>
  <p>I have a spare laptop&mdash;a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111947">15-inch MacBook Pro from 2017</a>&mdash;that I installed Ubuntu on sometime last year to understand Linux better. I did get a better understanding of how the hardware and OS work together (even <a href="/mbp-linux-wifi.html">wrote</a> <a href="/mbp-linux-power.html">posts</a> about it), but quickly ran into a roadblock on what else I could work on. My goals were to understand networking and develop Linux sysadmin skills.</p>
<p>I started lurking on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab">r/homelab</a> probably around the same time. Something about the term &ldquo;lab&rdquo; brings so much joy to me&mdash;a space where one could tinker to their heart&rsquo;s content, break things and fix them, and then share their findings. However, along with joy also came feelings of overwhelm, as most of the posts I saw there went over my head.</p>
<p>It was after a few chats with people at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a">Recurse Center</a> who were also working on their homelabs and searching for beginner posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab">r/homelab</a> that made things click for me.</p>
<p>Instead of running things on a single operating system or, what I needed was a hypervisor. I used to setup Linux/Windows virtual machines on my daily driver, but often had to delete them as they would take up a lot of space. Having a dedicated machine turned into a hypervisor solves this problem. The machine I&rsquo;m using has 2TB of storage, which is more than enough to create and delete as many VMs as I want. I chose <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview">Proxmox</a> as the hypervisor, which is built on top of the Debian Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Using a laptop instead of an actual server meant that I had some constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The machine connects to the Internet via WiFi and does not have an Ethernet port. Proxmox doesn&rsquo;t recommend using WiFi, however I tried my best to make it work. When I realized that it is too much of a limitation, I purchased a USB-to-Ethernet adapter. I learnt about how to get an Ethernet connection from my home router to my room for the first time, which was fun!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The machine is a laptop with a battery in it and the battery is quite power hungry, so keeping the machine up all day while plugged in wasn&rsquo;t seeming like a good idea. So I decided that I wouldn&rsquo;t keep the machine up at all times, and use it like a regular laptop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another constraint that I personally set was to rely on virtualization as much as possible and introduce additional hardware only where required. I wanted to get started quickly and not fall down the rabbit hole of deciding what hardware to buy. I also wanted to test the limits of the machine and tools I already had.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things I plan to work on, each of which might turn into one or more blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Setting up a virtual router to create an internal virtual network. This would help me learn about routing, <abbr title="Virtual LAN">VLAN</abbr>s, network protocols such as <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr>, and maybe even set up a <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> or a wireless access point to help me access the network from another machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authoritative <abbr title="Domain Name Server">DNS</abbr> server for the virtual network. I&rsquo;ve been curious about what setting up a DNS server might look like, and it would be nice to not have to remember the IP address and use domain names instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ethical hacking environment, which would include a Kali Linux and a Windows VM that I can use when participating in <abbr title="Capture the Flag">CTF</abbr>s. I&rsquo;ve also heard about people setting up VMs for learning Active Directory, emulating <abbr title="Security Operations Center">SOC</abbr>-like environments, but I haven&rsquo;t decided on details for it yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This might be against the &ldquo;not keeping the server up all the time&rdquo; constraint, but I have a lot of space on this machine + two external hard drives. A DIY <abbr title="Network Attached Storage">NAS</abbr> might be an interesting project to work on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
