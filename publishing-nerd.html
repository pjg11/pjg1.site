<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] Publishing nerds end up as inveterate yak shavers and one-man bands performing in their own driveways. Our ingrained preference to control all levels of design, and the facility which computers give us for doing so, tend to preclude us from cross-pollinating and collaborating, which for most of us is a big developmental hazard</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel called out by this post. I think a lot about how my posts look visually, maybe too much. The hours I&rsquo;ve spent designing this website has been time spent away from writing and <a href="/intentional-engagement.html">collaborating with people</a>.</p>
<p>I still enjoy working on the designing and don&rsquo;t want to stop completely. so I&rsquo;ll have to think of ways to balance writing and designing better.</p>
