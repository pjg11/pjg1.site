  <h2 id="smol-pr-victory">Smol PR victory</h2>
<p>I submitted <a href="https://github.com/robinovitch61/wander/pull/138">a PR</a> for wander, which got merged! I came across a similar bug recently, so the fix in terms of code was simple.</p>
<p>Understanding the codebase was the tougher part, which the project&rsquo;s maintainer (and fellow Recurser) very kindly walked me through in a chat.</p>
<h2 id="blog-post-struggles">Blog post struggles</h2>
<p>I thought publishing these weeknotes would make writing other posts easier. I was wrong.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like pushing through it either, I&rsquo;ve sort of lost interest. Maybe having the code in a repo + a README is sufficient? Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<h2 id="ctf-adventures">CTF adventures</h2>
<p>A group of Recursers decided to participate in <a href="https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com">Google CTF</a> over the weekend! I hadn&rsquo;t played a CTF in a while, so my skills were rusty (they were basic to begin with). And Google CTF in particular is tough, where even the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; challenges are not that easy.</p>
<p>I fell into a rabbit hole with one of the challenges, and that path wasn&rsquo;t helpful in solving it AT ALL :/</p>
<p>Regardless, the rabbit hole was really interesting. I started looking into terminal escape sequences, a combination of characters that allow for functionality in the terminal - printing text in different colors being an example.</p>
<p>I was particularly interested in terminal injection - using certain sequences in a way that lets me execute shell commands. Turns out that wasn&rsquo;t possible (the code was escaping the escape sequences), but I left with a better understanding of how it works.</p>
<p>Here are some links I found helpful:</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>Did I work in a more structured way than usual? Not really, but I had one big win: I didn&rsquo;t fall down the &ldquo;maintaining my website&rdquo; rabbit hole! I decided on this earlier in the week, and I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;m stuck to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also realized that there are times I&rsquo;m learning things that don&rsquo;t feel useful in the moment, but help me in another situation.</p>
<p>For example, the bug fix for wander was something I came across in one of my personal projects. I dropped that project mid-way, so it wasn&rsquo;t particularly useful there. However, having worked on that code helped me figure out the exact fix in this case, which was cool.</p>
