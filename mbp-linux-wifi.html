<h1>Installing Ubuntu on a 2017 MBP - fixing WiFi troubles</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-09-09 16:00:00 +0400">September 9, 2024</time></p>
<p>I'd been curious on what it's like to use Linux as the main OS, and wanted to upgrade from my <a href="/linux-vm-setup">Linux VM setup</a> for a while now. So when a family member was upgrading to a newer machine, I asked for their older machine - a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111947">2017 MacBook Pro</a> - and decided to install Linux on it.</p>

<p>I chose Ubuntu as that's the distro I'm most comfortable with. After some initial research, I created a bootable installer using <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview">this guide</a> and proceeded with the install which went smoothly. Ubuntu also booted much faster compared to macOS on the same machine, so I was feeling good about this.</p>

<p>The feel-good-ness went away fairly quickly, as I started to notice major problems - one of them being that the WiFi wouldn't connect. I could see the list of networks, but it got stuck at the connecting stage after I entered the password. I failed to catch this during the installation process as I skipped the "Connect to WiFi" step.</p>

<p>With the power of the search engine, I came to the conclusion that the WiFi driver was missing. The driver was available via <code>apt</code>, but I needed WiFi for <code>apt</code> to work. The solution I kept coming across was to get a direct connection via Ethernet and then install. Great idea, except my machine doesn't have an Ethernet port.</p>

<p><em>womp womp</em></p>

<p>While I was sure I would need an Ethernet adapter and even planned on buying one, I wrote about this situation in <a href="/weeknotes-32-2024">a weeknote</a> in the slight hopes of finding an alternate solution. And I DID! A fellow Recurser reached out with links I hadn't come across, and <a href="https://www.amirootyet.com/post/how-to-get-wifi-to-work-after#without-internet-connection">one of them</a> provided the required driver as a ZIP file with installation instructions.</p>

<p>And that's when it clicked - I can download the required files on a machine that has WiFi and transfer them via USB. A very obvious idea in hindsight, I'm still wondering why I didn't think of this earlier.</p>

<p>While the file in the post didn't work, I now knew what to search for, and then came across <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/730799/installing-firmware-b43-installer-offline/730813#730813">this answer on askubuntu</a>. I downloaded the two files it suggests:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the driver itself - <code>broadcom-wl-5.100.138</code></li>
  <li>a package called <code>b43-fwcutter</code> that extracts the firmware specific to the hardware on my system</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I transferred these files via USB, I ran the remaining steps, and had working WiFi!!!</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo dpkg -i b43-fwcutter_015-9_amd64.deb
$ tar xfvj broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2
$ sudo b43-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware broadcom-wl-5.100.138/linux/wl_apsta.o
$ sudo modprobe b43</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/626642/how-to-install-broadcom-wireless-drivers-offline/1244412#1244412">Another answer</a> in another thread suggested installing the package via <code>apt</code> once the WiFi works so future updates would be managed by <code>apt</code>, which I thought was a nice idea.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt install b43-firmware-installer</code></pre>

<p>The WiFi signal appeared to be pretty weak in the top bar, however I didn't face any issues while running <code>apt install</code>, interesting.</p>

<p>So problem solved, right? Not reaally. When I logged into the machine a few days later, the WiFi stopped connecting once again.</p>

<p>On further searching, I came across <a href="https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux">mbp-2016-linux</a> - an absolute gem of a resource that mentions what works and doesn't work on Linux for the 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro's. Particularly, the section about WiFi caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar come with a <code>Broadcom Limited BCM43602 802.11ac Wireless LAN SoC (rev 02)</code> which is also supported by <code>brcmfmac</code>, but has several issues rendering it unusable, caused by the available firmware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My machine has a Touch Bar, let me check what hardware I have:</p>

<pre><code>$ lspci -nn | grep Network
03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM43602 802.11ac Wireless Lan SoC [14e4:43ba] (rev 02)</code></pre>

<p>Aaand it's the same one. This was confusing since I got WiFi working earlier, that wasn't a dream. So now I needed to figure out what apart from installing the drivers made it work.</p>

<p>Then I remembered a command I ran in my initial attempt at fixing WiFi - copy-pasting commands without knowing what they do. It seemed relevant enough here for some reason, so I ran it again.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo iwconfig wlp3s0 txpower 10dBm</code></pre>

<p>Reconnected the WiFi, and I had a working connection again! I tried figuring out what led to this confusion, and here's what happened:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The drivers were still missing when I ran the command the first time, so it didn't work on its own.</li>
  <li>Once I had the correct driver, I forgot I ran this command and thought that the drivers alone made it work.</li>
</ul>

<p>This command is suggested as a workaround after installing the driver, and comes from this <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193121">bug report</a>. I'm not really sure why this works (if you do, let me know!), but it does explain why the WiFi signal appears weak after connecting.</p>

<p>Based on replies in the report and issues on mbp-2016-linux, this isn't a guaranteed fix but rather a "your mileage may vary" fix. I been using WiFi with this fix for a few weeks and haven't faced any issues, so looks like it seemed to work fine in my case (yay!)</p>

<p>Okay one last thing before I wrap up this post. This workaround isn't a one-time fix, so I had to type the command and restart the WiFi on each boot to make it work. That got repetitive, so I recently created and enabled a <code>systemd</code> service to run these commands on boot.</p>

<pre><code># mbp-linux-wifi.service
[Unit]
Description=Fixes to make WiFi work on a MBP running Linux
Requires=network.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/iwconfig wlp3s0 txpower 10dBm
ExecStart=/usr/bin/systemctl restart NetworkManager
RemainAfterExit=yes
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>

<p>Earlier iterations of this service failed to run, since it would sometimes try to execute commands before the wireless interface (<code>wlp3s0</code>) is even detected. To solve this, I added the <code>Restart</code> and <code>RestartSec</code> parameters to retry after it fails, and now it connects shortly after booting.</p>
