<p>Both these weeks were busy with work stuff, some changes in routine (aka me trying to keep up with a show I really like) and lots of procrastination, which meant little to no progress on personal projects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to readjust my routine to start making progress, which hasn&rsquo;t been successful so far, so here&rsquo;s a short note summarizing the last two weeks.</p>
<h2 id="making-progress-on-a-c-project">Making progress on a C project</h2>
<p>I revisited a project I mentioned in a <a href="https://pjg1.site/weeknotes-24-2024#figuring-out-how-to-read-a-file-in-the-ext4-filesystem">previous weeknote</a> and attemtpted to port the rest of code in the post. It kind of works, but some cases don&rsquo;t, and debugging those cases is the next step.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-personal-wiki">Starting a personal wiki?</h2>
<p>I was recently helping out refactor the internal wiki at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a">Recurse Center</a>, and that inspired me to start my own. However, having separate wiki pages started to create confusion with the dev journal system, so I&rsquo;m thinking on how to incorporate this with the journal itself.</p>
<h2 id="lots-of-thinking">Lots of thinking</h2>
<p>Since I was finding it tough to get started on something, I decided to spend time planning in the hopes that something would click. I&rsquo;m in the process of breaking down projects into smaller, manageable tasks, and priortizing which ones to focus on.</p>
<h2 id="browserengineering">browser.engineering</h2>
<p>Riding the wave of the start of a new batch and new events at RC, I decided to join a study group working through the <a href="https://browser.engineering">Web Browser Engineering</a> book. I had this book saved in my &ldquo;someday&rdquo; list for a while, and this study group seemed like a good opportunity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working through the Chapter 1 exercises, and it seems interesting so far. Not sure if I&rsquo;ll work through the entire book though.</p>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>The new additions to my routine meant that my existing routine isn&rsquo;t working. This was also reflective in my dev journal, where I have very few notes from these two weeks.</p>
<p>Attempts at readjusting my routine shall continue.</p>
