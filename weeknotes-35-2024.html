<h2 id="wifi-works-on-the-linux-machine">WiFi works on the Linux machine!</h2>
<p>I figured out why the WiFi stopped working again, and went down quite an interesting rabbit hole. I&rsquo;ve started working on a draft describing the situation (my first non-weeknote post after ages, eeeee), so I&rsquo;ll save details for that post.</p>
<p>One fun thing I did after WiFi started working was running an nginx server on my machine and accessing the default page from my daily driver. I&rsquo;ve tried this on a server in the cloud before, but running it on machine and accessing it from another machine in the same network felt very cool.</p>
<p>This homelab stuff makes me feel like a kid discovering things for the first time, and it feels awesome.</p>
<h2 id="the-website-fixes-continue">The website fixes continue</h2>
<p>After having pushed the initial version of the design, I still had some TODOs left, and even some feedback regarding the colors that I wanted to implement. Since the WiFi problem got solved quickly, I ended up spending the rest of my time on this. Some changes I made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed CSS - increased contrast for dark mode and made the colors more consistent across modes.</li>
<li>Added an introduction line to the homepage</li>
<li>Replaced terminal GIFs with <a href="https://asciinema.org">asciinema</a> recordings in posts</li>
<li>Moved <a href="/hanukkahofdata">Hanukkah of Data</a> from a standalone page to a post</li>
<li>Minor post edits</li>
<li>Added alt text to images</li>
<li>Realized that some images were probably not required while writing alt text, so deleted them</li>
<li>Added a <a href="/colophon">colophon</a> page</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="terminal-and-text-editor-themes-updated">Terminal and text editor themes updated</h2>
<p>Inspired by the minimal design of my website, I updated the themes for my text editor (Sublime Text atm) and Terminal application (iTerm) to match. On Sublime, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/cowwabanga/sublime-almost-mono/tree/main">sublime-almost-mono</a> while I went for a completely monochrome theme for iTerm. Only white text on a black background (or vice-versa for light mode), no colors.</p>
<h2 id="changing-accountability-mechanisms">Changing accountability mechanisms</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve somehow managed to post weeknotes for about three months now - sometimes weekly, sometimes bi-weekly. I think it&rsquo;s time to take a break from them though, as it&rsquo;s no longer an effective accountability mechanism for me.</p>
<p>I hoped that writing these would help me get more comfortable publishing on a regular basis, and that would translate into me writing more technical posts focused on a particular topic. While I did get comfortable publishing, I haven&rsquo;t written any technical posts since I started these.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve been able to generate ideas through other ways (identifying gaps in my knowledge and thinking of resources/projects to learn them), I would rather spend time working on those ideas and writing about them instead of weeknotes. It seems like a natural progression.</p>
<p>Weeknotes are a great format though, and I&rsquo;m glad I wrote them for as long as I did. I would encourage them to anyone who wants to write but is unsure what to write about, I&rsquo;m likely going to restart these whenever I&rsquo;m in a rut.</p>
<p>My new accountability mechanism is something more direct - an accountability buddy! <a href="https://swagnik.netlify.app">Swagnik</a> - a fellow Recurser - and I have started weekly meetings to reflect and discuss our plans for the week. The fact that I&rsquo;m being held accountable by one single person instead of putting out a message on a chat platform or this blog is making a difference, and probably what I needed.</p>
