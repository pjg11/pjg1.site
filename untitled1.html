<p>I am delaying a macOS update. Not due to laziness, but because I don’t like macOS and iOS 26. I might be considering not upgrading at all.</p>
<p>I stopped keeping up with the iPhone updates a long time ago. The phone sizes were getting too big for my liking, so I was holding on to the iPhone SE for as long as I could. Then I received the iPhone 12 as a gift. Apart from the size (which I’m now used to) the main thing that put me off was the camera. Something changed in how the pictures looked, and I didn’t like it. Additionally, my lifestyle changed in a way where I ended up using my phone a lot less<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I’ve used Apple products since about 2010/2011 (maybe even earlier if you take the iPods into consideration), entering the ecosystem in 2014 when I got my first Mac. Fast forward to today, and Apple is starting to lose its charm for me. I know I’m not alone in this feeling.</p>
<p>I might have experienced this feeling a lot earlier, maybe around 2023, with the M1 series of laptops being the last thing that caught my interest. I lost interest in the phones a long time ago.</p>
